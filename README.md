# Henry comments 18/April
- You need a licenses.txt and changelog.txt/.md file
- All images should go into an images/ directory (depending on what platform you are using)
- You need a data/ directory somewhere to store your text-based data.
- Where is your project code??

# Henry comments 27/April
- This file still needs compile instructions, and directory explanation so I know where to find stuff.
- Your changelog needs a lot of work
- Your data hasn't progressed enough. You need to get to this very quickly, as you can't start building your game until you can at least load the levels/world of your game. So work on getting loading working (from data files) asap.
- I'd suggest putting your data/ directory inside your project directory, so that you can load it in code.
